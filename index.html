            <h1>WELCOME!</h1>
            <p>Hi, this page is all about the city <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shillong" target="blank" title="wiki shillong"> Shillong</a> located in the East Khasi Hills 
                district of state <a href="http://meghalaya.gov.in/" target="blank" title="Meghalaya"> Meghalaya</a>.
                Shillong is a hill station in the northeastern part of India and the capital of Meghalaya,
                 which means "The Abode of Clouds" . It is the headquarters of the East Khasi Hills district. 
                 Shillong is the 330th most populous city in India with a population of 143,229 according 
                 to the 2011 census. 
                 It is said that the rolling hills around the town reminded the British of Scotland. 
                 Hence, they would also refer to it as the "Scotland of the East".</p>
            <h2>HISTORY of SHILLONG</h2>
            <p>
                Shillong was capital for composite Assam during the British regime and later till a separate 
                State of Meghalaya was formed. David Scott, the British civil servant of the East India 
                Company, was the Agent of the Governor-General North East Frontier. During the First 
                Anglo-Burmese War the British authorities felt the need for a road to connect Sylhet 
                and Assam. The route was to traverse across the Khasi and Jaintia Hills. David Scott 
                overcame the difficulties his administration faced from the opposition of the Khasi Syiems – 
                their chiefs and people. Impressed by the favourable cool climate of Khasi Hills, they 
                negotiated with the Syiem of Sohra in 1829 for a sanatorium for the British. Thus began the 
                consolidation of British interests in the Khasi-Jaintia Hills.
